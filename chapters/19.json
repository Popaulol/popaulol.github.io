She thinks about who this rule change would benifit and who it wouldn't. She goes back to sleep when she wakes up again she is determined to find Peeta, trying to figure out where he is. She starts a fire to distract the other Tributes and then starts following the stream. She finds a bloody trail on a rock, suggesting that one of the Tributes, probably Peeta was here a few days ago as it had already dried. She continues on the stream and finds Peeta camouflaged in the mud. After they talk she gets him out of the mud towards the stream to clean him of and treat his wounds. They go further down the Stream together and find a cave where they go into a cave where Katniss continues taking care of Peeta. They kiss and they get send a Pot of Stew.",
