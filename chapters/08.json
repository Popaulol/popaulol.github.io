  "summary": "Katniss goes to her room and lays on her bed crying thinking she fucked up majorly, sending away everyone and waiting for guards to come to take her away but that doesn't happen. She does decide to head to Dinner where Haymitch asks them how the Private Training went. Peeta threw around the weights but was mostly ignored by the Gamemakers. After Katniss tells them what she did they cheer her back up with the fact that they can't easily remove her from the Hunger Games by this point and they will just hope she doesn't win the Games. Katniss ends up getting a score of 11 from the Gamemakers, which is one of the highest scores possible. Katniss is in disbelief when Haymitch explains that the Gamemakers probably like people with Temper to spice up the Games. When Katniss heads to bed she thinks about what it means for each other that she and Peeta both scored well with the Gamemakers. When she makes up she reminisces about he first time she met Gale and how their relationship compares to the one she has with Peeta. When Effie Trinket gets her from her room, she takes a quick shower and then heads down to the dining Area. She joins Effie, Haymitch and Peeta at the table and Haymitch tells her that Peeta has asked to be coached seperately from her.",
