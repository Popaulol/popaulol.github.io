  "summary": "If Katniss hadn't strapped herself into the tree she's in now, she would've fallen out of it hwn she realized Peeta had Teamed up with the Careers. She overhears the Careers talking about her and Peeta when he comes back after having finished of the girl that wasn't quite dead. A hovercraft comes and picks her body up when Katniss decides to pack her sleeping bag and get out of the tree. She checks her Traps and has caught one rabbit in them which she proceeds to cook over the dead girls fire. She also tries to camoflage her backpack with dirt and then heads of in the opposite direction the Careers went. Continuing her search for water, she finds some berries that she doesn't regognise so she thinks they're probably poisonous. She walks until the end of the day without finding water, straps herself into another tree and sees during the death recap that no one becides the girl Peeta killed died that day. When she wakes up she's badly suffering from dehydration, hoping for Haymitch to have found a sponsor to send her some water into the arena. Since it doesn't happen she tries to continue on to find some water. When she is seconds away from passing out she falls into mud, realizing she had finally found some water. She drinks the water after having purified it with iodine. She goes to sleep getting woken up by a wall of fire descending on her.",
