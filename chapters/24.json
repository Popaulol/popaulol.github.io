Peeta convices Katniss to go back to the cave for the night and she relents to keep up the love act. They eat a bit more and Peeta goes to sleep first. Then he guards her whilst she sleeps. When they both make up they decide to go hunting again, after eating as much as they can, as they're suspecting this will be the last day of the Hunger Games. They see that the stream and other ponds have dried up, so they recognise the gamemakers want to draw them to the lake and they head there, staying in the open to attract Cato. Cato comes running out of the woods, running away from a pack of Creatures hunting him.",
