  "summary": "When Katniss realizes that Rue is pointing at a wasps nest, she panicks as they are probalby genetically engineered wasps that are far more effective at killing than normal wasps are. Katniss has the idea of dropping the nest onto the Tributes below by sawing its branch of whilst the anthem is playing to mask the noise. She can't finish the sawing during the anthem and when she climbs back down to her sleeping back she sees that she got a medicine supply for her burns which makes her pain fully go away after having been applied, she goes into her sleeping bag and falls asleep. When she wakes up again, she gives her leg another coating of the ointment, eats something and packs all her supplies. She tells Rue what she's about to do who immediatly flees by jumping from tree to tree. Whilst Katniss does the final Sawing she gets stung by the wasps multiple times but she is able to set the branch with the nest going to the ground. Whilst only three wasps attacked Katniss, the rest of them goes after the Careers and Peeta. A girl from district 4 probably dies from the stings with the rest fleeing towards the lake. Katniss is effected by their poison but survives. She goes back to get the bow and arrows from the girl called glimmer. When Peeta comes out of the woods again and tells her to run. Ants start to come out of the blisters on her hands and she falls unconyious whilst they crawls into her eyes.",
