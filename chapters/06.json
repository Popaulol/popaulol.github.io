Katniss is amazed of all the Gadgets she has in her quarters. She showers, gets herself a new outfit and eats something until Effie calls her to dinner where she meets back up with Peeta, Haymitch, Effie and the two stylists. When one of the servants brings a cake, Katniss recognises her but can't figure how why and Peeta helps her out of the sticky situation by faking also recognising her. They all watch a reply of the opening ceremony together. Afterwards the adults send Peeta and Katniss back to their rooms. They end up going to the buildings roof together instead and Peeta shows Katniss the garden where they end up talking about how Katniss recognised the girl.
